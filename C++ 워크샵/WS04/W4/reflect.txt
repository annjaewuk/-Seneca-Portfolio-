 First, composition relationships are stronger than aggregate relationships. 
In a composition, child classes cannot exist independently of the parent class. 
In an aggregate, objects can exist independently. 
The composition is responsible for the creation or destruction of part objects. 
However, the aggregation is not responsible for creating or destroying those parts.

 Second, in the composition, the composer transfers ownership by reassigning the pointer to the object. 
Since the composer completely owns the part object, it creates a copy of the object in memory. 
In an aggregate, the aggregator reallocates a pointer to the move function's memory. 
Aggregators can exist independently, so they only copy a pointer to the part object in the copy function.
