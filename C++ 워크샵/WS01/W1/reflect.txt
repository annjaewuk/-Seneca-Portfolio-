Workshop:             1


 In this workshop I learned how to take program arguments from the command line, 
how to protect class definitions from iteration, 
and how to access variables defined in different translation units.

 First, I added the file provided to the resource file, access the property, and apply it in Command Arguments of the Debugging tab.
It was not a difficult task, but it was difficult to understand how it works.

 Second, Repeatability caused link errors. 
This could be resolved by declaring a variable in the header file using the extern function and making a general declaration in the cpp file of the module.

 In addition, By putting two colons in front of the variable like ::g_sysClock, the compiler could access the variables defined in different translation units.

 Lastly, since the second semester, dynamic memory allocation and memory-related issues have been a big headache. 
In addition to reinforcing this part, I felt that additional learning was needed for concepts such as local variables.
