 First, when I declared vector as std::vector<Vehicle*> m_vehicles; , I stored pointers in the vector. 
Then the vector allocated memory to store the pointers. The vector only frees the memory it allocates within itself, not the memory that they point to. 
I need to delete that memory, otherwise I would have a memory leak.

 Second, when there is an unknown type of vehicle, the type is not recognized, it would display unrecognized record type: [type]. 
If the record contains invalid data, it would display the error message.

 Lastly, if I declare like this std::list<sdds::Vehicle> and std::vector<sdds::Vehicle>, I store objects themselves. 
std::vector<sdds::Vehicle*> allow me to use polymorphism and store related objects in the same vector, but I cannot do it with objects with non-pointers. 
In addition, std::list<sdds::Vehicle*> and std::vector<sdds::Vehicle*> use pointers to reduce copy time.
