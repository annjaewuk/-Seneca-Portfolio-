 First, why was necessary to use binary files in this worksho and how did you use them is because binary files are smaller than text files. 
There is no need to convert from one to the other, so input and output are much faster if I use binary files. 
In a word, binary files can save time and space.

 Second, why would be important to bind a function to its arguments, and how was it useful in this workshop is because it is more concise than actually writing a functor class to do it. 
Using bind can take less typing, it's more clearer. When I use it, I simply know it is focused solely on function binding. 

 Lastly, the advantages of using multiple threads, and how did you accomplished multi-threading in this workshop? 
I can execute multiple parts at the sanme time by using multiple threads and also each thread can run on a different processor in parallel using multithreading. 
This can increase concurrency of the system. Threads share the process resources, so it's cheaper and less time-consuming to use threads than to create processes as they require more resources.
