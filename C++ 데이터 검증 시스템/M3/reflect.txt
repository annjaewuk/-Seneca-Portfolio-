 By following these milestones, I had the opportunity to reinforce the core knowledge I learned during this semester. 
I learned about copy and move semantics, containers, algorithms, smart pointers, and more. 
They are all very useful. In the end, vectors were used. Vectors, like dynamic arrays, have the ability to automatically resize when elements are inserted or deleted. 
And their storage is handled automatically by the container. Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so they can be accessed and traversed using iterators (e.g.begin(), end()). 
Many functions are associated with vectors like size() for capacity, push_back() and pop_front() for modifiers. 
Deques are similar to vectors, but are more efficient at inserting and deleting as they allow quick inserts and deletions at both the beginning and end. 
Deque's storage expansion is cheaper than vector because it copies existing elements to a new memory location. 
Finally, little things matter in the coding world. I have to consider the logical frame as well as the details that may affect the overall result.
