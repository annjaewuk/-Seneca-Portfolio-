In the final project, I built a parking application that can load vehicle information from a file, update parking information, and save the updated information to a file. 
Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism concepts were utilized in this project.

First, I learned how to read file data via "ifstream" and store the data in the Parking object via overloaded operators.

Second, I virtually coded the base class's destructor, even if there is no currently derived class from that base class.

Finally, I was able to remove redundant logic from the hierarchical system by improving some sort of containment polymorphism through input and output operator overloading.
